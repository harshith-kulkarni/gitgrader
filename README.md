## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today's tech world, a GitHub repository represents a developer's tangible work, but most students don't know how good, clean, or complete their code looks to recruiters or mentors. GitGrade solves this by providing automated, AI-powered analysis of any public GitHub repository.

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis
- **Groq SDK Integration**: Uses Groq's fast LLM inference for intelligent analysis
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Analyzes code quality, documentation, project structure, development activity, and best practices
- **Detailed Feedback**: Comprehensive AI-generated insights and recommendations

### 📊 Scoring System
- **0-100 Point Scale**: Comprehensive scoring across multiple dimensions
- **Rating Categories**: Beginner, Bronze, Silver, Gold classifications
- **Visual Breakdown**: Individual scores with progress bars and color coding

### 📝 Intelligent Feedback
- **Detailed Summary**: AI-generated comprehensive evaluation of repository
- **Project Description**: Clear explanation of what the project does
- **Tech Stack Analysis**: Analysis of technology choices and appropriateness
- **Personalized Roadmap**: 5-6 specific, actionable improvement suggestions

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- Modern React 18 with hooks
- Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Interactive file tree visualization
- Real-time analysis feedback

### Backend (Python + Groq)
- Flask API server
- Groq SDK for AI analysis
- Structured prompt engineering
- JSON response parsing

### Analysis Dimensions

1. **Code Quality (25 points)**: File organization, naming conventions, linting setup
2. **Documentation (20 points)**: README quality, code comments, API docs
3. **Project Structure (20 points)**: Folder organization, test coverage
4. **Development Activity (20 points)**: Commit frequency, message quality
5. **Best Practices (15 points)**: CI/CD, version control practices, licensing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitgrade.git
cd gitgrade
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file and add your Groq API key
```

### 3. Start the AI Backend
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 4. Start the Frontend
```bash
# In a new terminal
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open the Application
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 📋 Usage

1. **Enter Repository URL**: Paste any GitHub repository URL
2. **Click "Grade Repository"**: The system will fetch data and analyze with AI
3. **View Results**: Get comprehensive analysis including:
   - Overall score and rating
   - Detailed breakdown by category
   - Repository structure visualization
   - Technology stack analysis
   - AI-generated summary and feedback
   - Personalized improvement roadmap

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Groq Integration
The system uses the Groq Python SDK exactly as specified:

```python
from groq import Groq

client = Groq(api_key="your-api-key")

def chat_with_groq(prompt):
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="llama3-8b-8192",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3,
        max_tokens=2000
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

### Analysis Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Fetch repository metadata, commits, files, README
2. **Data Processing**: Analyze file structure, detect tech stack, process commits
3. **AI Analysis**: Send structured data to Groq for intelligent evaluation
4. **Response Processing**: Parse AI response and format for frontend
5. **Visualization**: Display results with interactive UI components
